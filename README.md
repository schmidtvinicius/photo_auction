# Photo auctions:
This was a school project I made for my 'Webtechnologie' class.

## Objectives:
- Create a single page application for a photography** auctions website that was served by a REST API
- The front-end was made using Svelte
- The back-end (REST API) was made using Node.js and express
- The integration between front-end and back-end was made using sapper

** **The objective of this project was to get familiar with Svelte and JavaScript. For that reason I decided to not add any actual images to simulate the photographs, but I instead focused on getting all other functionality working as best as possible.**

## Things I learned:
- Svelte is a very flexible and user friendly framework. It is much simpler than React, for example, and the code for each component is very human-readable, because of its neat structure.
- REST APIs are very powerful because they make it possible to communicate with various clients using the same data format.
- How to create reactive websites using Svelte.
- How to make pagination elements with both "raw" JavaScript and Svelte.
- How to manage user sessions and permissions.
- How to store passwords and authenticate users.
