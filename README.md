# Photo auctions

## Objectives:
- Create a single page application for a photography auctions website that was served by a REST API
- The front-end was made using Svelte
- The back-end (REST API) was made using Node.js and express
- The integration between front-end and back-end was made using sapper

## Things I learned:
- Svelte is a very flexible and user friendly framework. It is much simpler than React, for example, and the code for each component is very human-readable, because of its neat structure.
- REST APIs are very powerful because they make it possible to communicate with various clients using the same data format.
